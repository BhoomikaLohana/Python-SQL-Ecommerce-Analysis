## Technologies Used
- Python
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various CSV files providing detailed information related to the eCommerce transactions, including:

- **customers.csv**: Contains information about customers, such as demographics and account details.
- **orders.csv**: Includes records of customer orders, timestamps, and statuses.
- **sellers.csv**: Provides details about sellers participating in the eCommerce platform.
- **products.csv**: Contains information about products available for sale, including categories and pricing.
- **geolocation.csv**: Offers geolocation data related to customer addresses, helping analyze regional trends.
- **payments.csv**: Includes payment details for each order, such as payment methods and statuses.
- **order_items.csv**: Contains details of the individual items within each order, including quantities and product IDs.

These datasets collectively allow for a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, sales performance, and market trends.

 ## Analysis and Results
In this project, we optimized SQL queries to perform comprehensive data analysis and extract meaningful insights from the target eCommerce dataset. Our analysis focused on several key areas, including customer demographics, sales performance, and product trends.

We conducted basic, intermediate, and advanced analyses to uncover valuable information such as unique customer locations, order counts, total sales per category, and customer retention rates. These insights enable us to better understand customer behavior and improve business strategies.

### Visualization
By integrating SQL with Python, we also visualized the data to present our findings more effectively. Key visualizations include:
- The count of customers by state.
- Bar plots representing orders placed monthly.
- The top 5 sellers based on revenue.

These visualizations provide a clearer picture of the trends and patterns in the eCommerce data, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of combining SQL queries with Python for comprehensive data analysis in the eCommerce sector. Through optimized queries and visualizations, we gained valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

Key findings highlight the importance of understanding customer demographics and purchasing patterns, which can significantly influence marketing strategies and inventory management. The visualizations provided clear, actionable insights that can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions to drive business growth.

Looking ahead, further analysis could explore additional datasets or incorporate machine learning techniques to predict future sales trends or customer behavior. The insights gained from this project not only enhance our understanding of the current market landscape but also lay the groundwork for data-driven strategies in the eCommerce industry.
